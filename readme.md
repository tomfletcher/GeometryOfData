## Description

Modern data are high-dimensional, multi-modal, and large-scale, for example, images with millions of pixels, text corpora with millions of words, gene sequences with billions of base pairs, etc. However, these data tend to concentrate on lower-dimensional, nonlinear subspaces known as manifolds. Learning and sampling from this real distribution, hence, is of tremendous value. This class covers the mathematical theory of
high-dimensional geometry and manifolds and how it applies to the latest advances in artificial intelligence.
